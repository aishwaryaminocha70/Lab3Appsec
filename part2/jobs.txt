Title: Part2 - Migration and Seeding jobs
Name: Aishwarya Minocha

Since the setup.sql handles the migration and seeding I commented out the code in the db/Dockerfile to start that:
lines 6-9 of db/Dockerfile
    #COPY ./setup.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup.sql

    #ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
    #CMD ["mysqld", "--secure-file-priv=/data"]

Next I created a migration-job.yaml and put the commands that we used in hw2 in to handle the migration:

    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args: ["python3 ../manage.py makemigrations && python3 ../manage.py migrate"]

Before starting the migration job, I decided to use django fixtures for the seeding.  Since this uses the JSON format
Export of the seed data in JSON: python3 manage.py dumpdata > seed.json

Then I created the seed-job.yaml file with the command to load the JSON data in it:

    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args: ["python3 manage.py loaddata seed.json"]

Afterwards I re-built the docker image and started the containers using the script I made by parting out the original script provided and adding my own twist.

I confirmed both jobs completed successfully in the terminal window and by navigating the site successfully
