Title: Part1 - Secrets
Name: Aishwarya Minocha

I changed the SECRET_KEY variable in settings.py to pull from the environment, but, since I wanted to confirm that the 
Django pod wouldn't run without the key I used kubectl get pods to make sure there wasn't anything I missed.

Then I created two YAML files for K8s to run off of.   One is db-secrets.yaml for the sql pswd and the other is 
Django-secret-key.yaml for the Django secret key.  Used base64 for encryption for the secrets in the files as per the documentation.  
I also modified the db-deployment.yaml and the Django-deploy.yaml to incorporate the environmental variables created by the K8 secrets.

After rebuilding the images and restarting minikube, it showed the images as working.

Please note this would not be ideal for production due to it storing the passwords in easily accessable yaml files, but, most of this code wouldn't be used
in production so...

Commands used:
To convert from plain text to base64: <Plain text>|base64

Changed how the secret key is accessed in the settings.py:
SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
