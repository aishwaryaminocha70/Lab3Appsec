Title: Part1 - Secrets
Name: Aishwarya Minocha

I changed the SECRET_KEY variable in settings.py to pull from the environment, but, since I wanted to confirm that the 
Django pod wouldn't run without the key I used kubectl get pods to make sure there wasn't anything I missed.

Then I created two YAML files for K8s to run off of.   One is db-secrets.yaml for the sql pswd and the other is 
Django-secret-key.yaml for the Django secret key.  Used base64 for encryption for the secrets in the files as per the documentation.  
I also modified the db-deployment.yaml and the Django-deploy.yaml to incorporate the environmental variables created by the K8 secrets.

After rebuilding the images and restarting minikube, it showed the images as working.
